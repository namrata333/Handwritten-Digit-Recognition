The project recognizes human handwritten digits using Convolutional Neural Network.
It takes the input from a wide variety of sources like cheques, letters, etc. including the MNIST dataset and loaded through Keras API which is then fed into the multilayer perceptron for normalization by feed forward and back propagation.
The error is calculated using error functions and cross entropy. The output image is shown in the user interface developed using Tkinter.
